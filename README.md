# Kaggle Competition: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

About the Project
This repository is an ongoing project, where I continually update it with new implementations and optimized solutions for the Titanic survival prediction problem. My goal is to implement the most effective methods and techniques to make this repository a valuable resource for learning.

Problem Understanding
The goal of the Titanic project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and ticket fare.
It's a binary classification problem where the target variable is "Survived" (1 if survived, 0 if not survived).
